							<p>To those of you who have clicked this far into my portfolio... thank you. To summarize a little about myself in this section, my portfolio/interests may appear scattered but thats because I've always been interested in many things. I've been interested in careers such as Software Engineering, Quantitative Finance, Investment Banking and many more. I'm a person 
								who strives to continue learning regardless of the field, and I'm usually attracted to difficult concepts in Tech/Finance. Ever since I can remember I've always been a wild bag who is interested in a array of things. 
								As I matured it has consolidated to the fields of Tech/Finance and I hope to continue to learn and become the greatest I can be within these two fields I have been interested in since a child. Thank you for viewing my portfolio and have a wonderful day.
